# Dependencies

### Introduction

This project defines all dependencies and their versions. 
The resulting dependency can be used by all projects and provides a decentralized way for all projects to use the same versions of all dependencies.

This project is based on the Gradle plugin from Spring: Dependency Management Plugin

This allows dependencies to be written without a version number, just like Spring managed dependencies.
